Remarks to be followed by the Keynote Speaker Dr. Mark Sagar. The essence of animation is creating the illusion of life, convincing the audience that a character is alive and has its own feelings and thoughts. Is it possible to bring an interactive digital character to life who can think, feel, have experiences, and act with volition? What is it, exactly, to think, to feel, to experience? In this keynote, Dr. Mark Sagar will discuss his team’s biologically based approach, where they are developing a virtual nervous system analogous to our own, combining computational models of sensory, cognitive and emotional processes, language, behavior, and motor systems. These systems activate virtual muscles to animate a virtual face and body, sensing, learning, acting, and reacting in real time. The interoperation of these systems in face-to-face and shared interactions is exemplified in projects like BabyX, a simulated toddler which aims to enhance our comprehension of social learning and behavior — but it can also serve as groundwork for achieving human-like cooperation with future artificial intelligence. Dr. Sagar will elaborate how creating the inner life of a character is strongly linked with the body, one of the central thematic focuses of the conference. Double-Academy Award winner Dr. Mark Sagar is the co-founder and Chief Scientific Officer of Soul Machines and Director of the Laboratory for Animate Technologies at the Auckland Bioengineering Institute. Mark and his team are bringing technology to life, pioneering the creation of autonomously animated virtual humans with virtual brains and nervous systems — capable of highly expressive face-to-face interaction and real-time learning and emotional response — to create the next generation of human interaction with biologically inspired artificial intelligence. Mark has a Ph.D. in engineering from the University of Auckland and was a postdoctoral fellow at MIT. He previously worked as the special projects supervisor at Weta Digital and Sony Pictures Imageworks and developed technology for the digital characters in blockbusters such Avatar, King Kong, and Spiderman 2. His pioneering work in computer-generated faces was recognized with two consecutive Scientific and Engineering Oscars in 2010 and 2011. Mark was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand in 2019 and was named New Zealand Innovator of the Year in 2022.","face, mark, virtual",General Research,https://s2024.conference-program.org/presentation/?id=keysp_101&sess=sess332

Entrusted with the director's vision of creating a world akin to being inside a living, breathing concept painting, the Wētā FX team went to work crafting the unique aesthetic, utilising Unreal Engine. In this session, Creative Director and VFX Supervisor Keith Miller will be joined by CG Supervisor, Ross McWhannell, Animation Supervisor, Aidan Martin, Digital Cinematographer, David Scott, and VFX Producer, Sophie Cherry to explore the art and technology employed across production.  Already familiar with Epic Games' Unreal Engine, the team endeavored to push the creative boundaries of the technology to ensure the emotional narrative of the film could be realised visually. From look development and animation style to creatively figuring out the story beats, the Wētā FX team was highly involved from the onset. The panel will talk through their approach to production - beginning with just a script and storyboard, they will discuss some of the anticipated challenges and why Unreal Engine was the adopted solution. Exploring the look development, the panel will provide insight into the artistic choices present throughout the film, looking at intricate details such as the texture, brush, and linework and how they blended the painterly visuals of the production design with the gritty realism of war. In this session, you'll be taken behind the scenes of the motion capture process and find out how later motion capture shoots could utilise Unreal Engine and the shots work done on the environments and characters. Unreal Engine served as the framework for the project – the focal point of the individual elements and disciplines fused into a unified working space. Rounding out the session, the panel will discuss how they leveraged the strengths and efficiencies of real-time filmmaking with Unreal Engine while integrating with their existing VFX animation pipelines, and how the real-time workflow enabled a new level of responsiveness, allowing for iterative freedom throughout the project.

In this talk, Visual Effects Supervisor's Erik Winquist, Kevin Smith, and Phillip Leonhardt and Animation Supervisors Paul Story, and Aidan Martin, will chart the evolution of this particular kind of character work, and the unique workflows that always make audiences go ape.  In this session, the panel will take a look at Wētā FX’s first foray into primates, starting with 2005’s King Kong, to discuss how the fully CG character marked a true technical achievement for the Animation, Motion Capture, and Facial Animation departments at the time. All things that laid the foundational approach for all primate characters that would follow. Jumping forward to 2011’s Rise of the Planet of the Apes, the panel will share insight into what it was like to reimagine the classic franchise’s main characters digitally for the first time, and explore the further enhancements to performance capture and facial performance systems that enabled audiences to emotionally connect to the characters.

In line with this teenager vibe, the director and the production designer, Yashar Kassai, established the idea that the film design would suggest that it was created by an immature teenager drawing this movie in his sketchbook, with all of his naivety and energy. The visual standards were very ambitious in that Mikros Animation was expected to deliver the quality and look of 2D concept art at each frame. To do that, Mikros and Paramount had to reconsider many parts of the classical CG workflow and pipeline, from asset creation to animation, through compositing. There have been many explorations of bringing 2D aesthetics into 3D. Mutant Mayhem was unique in pushing this stylization at every step for a look that was not simply toon-shaded, but a sophisticated use of color and moods. That includes: - The ability for modeling to simulate pencil lines with curves when developing their assets, giving another approach in the treatment of details. - Stepped animation without classical motion and the creation of pencil lines on the fly in Maya for various 2D motion blur effects and enhancements to expression. - A sophisticated lookdev workflow from surfacing to lighting, providing a stylized beauty pass to compositing with a good amount of control and graphic features. This included dynamic pencil grain applied on curve objects and the ability to give a painterly look to each light individually. The texture of the characters is not just painted, the lights themselves look like they are hand drawn. - Development in the lookdev of hair, one of the most challenging parts of giving a 2D look to a CG asset. Mikros approached the fabrication with procedural hair and a more specific shape to create a cohesive look. - Custom tools in compositing to develop a show-specific defocus, motion blur, and flares throughout all sequences. Building the stylization at each step gave the director a strong vision for the graphic quality of the assets and lighting out of render before the finalization of shots in compositing. All of these techniques were developed to give the best artistic leverage to each department, to add artistic and show specific features… and ultimately to create a hand-crafted feel.","2d, compositing, look",General Research,https://s2024.conference-program.org/presentation/?id=pros_119&sess=sess176

This venue, a multimedia mega-canvas, is unlike any other, and our presentation will cover the collaborative effort, creative challenges, and technical breakthroughs achieved within a demanding three-month timeline. Collaborative Efforts Behind the Scenes Central to the success of this project was the tight collaboration between artists and technologists. This multidisciplinary cooperation was crucial in tackling the complexities of producing content for one of the largest and most sophisticated screen surfaces ever built. Our session will showcase the collective ingenuity and problem-solving that brought our vision to life. Creative Challenges In just three months, our team managed to conceptualize, design, produce, and integrate over 8 hours of custom content, working under the motto of building the plane as we fly it. This required a rapid and flexible production approach. We'll discuss the creative and logistical hurdles of crafting four distinct shows that captured the band's spontaneous jam essence. These shows required a production style that could adapt dynamically to the band’s improvisational performances, without relying on traditional time-coded cues. Content Strategy The venue's dome-like screen demanded content with exceptional detail in ultra-high resolutions, pushing our team to new creative heights. We developed a modular show-flow incorporating various thematic elements, from takeover and graphic to abstract moments, designed to maximize pixel space usage. This strategy aimed to deliver a range of sensations and create immersive, illusionary effects. We'll outline how we balanced real-time and pre-rendered scenes and the pivotal role of Generative AI (Gen-AI) in accelerating our production pace and enhancing the visual narrative. Technical Challenges The project required pushing the limits of what's possible with cutting-edge technology. We'll explain how we utilized real-time engines like Notch and Unreal Engine to deliver smooth content at 10K resolution and 30fps. Our session will also cover the integration of Gen-AI-generated assets into our workflow, particularly through a multi-modular Diffusion model using ComfyUI. We faced numerous challenges with Gen-AI, including managing input types (images, texts, videos), structural control, upscaling techniques, and using detailers/refiners to enhance the detail in generated outputs. Visual 'Jamming' To align with the band's improvisational style, we developed a 'VJing-style' control toolbox. This toolbox, controllable externally through the grandMA lighting console, facilitated visual 'jamming' in sync with the band's live performances. We will discuss the effective use of this toolbox with layered pre-rendered content. Conclusion Our session aims to highlight Moment Factory’s dedication to innovation in location-based and large-scale multimedia experiences. We hope to inspire fellow creators and technologists to explore new creative territories and push beyond the familiar.","content, creative, production",General Research,https://s2024.conference-program.org/presentation/?id=pros_132&sess=sess180

Artists will delve into their work as collaborators, instructors, and community leaders on the Monuments to the Pluriverse exhibition, part of the groundbreaking UCR ARTS Digital Capture: Southern California and the Origins of the Pixel-Based Image World exhibition, which is a key component of the Getty Pacific Standard Time: Art x Science x Technology initiative. Each artist's work contributes to the rich tapestry of the pluriverse by exploring issues that affect minoritized communities while challenging traditional narratives and celebrating diverse perspectives. They will discuss the integration of artisanal rasquache techniques in VR and how this technology has served as a method to produce and share lesser-known quotidian heroic acts in coloniality. Baca (Co-Curator, Digital Capture) and Conlisk Gallegos (Curator, Monuments) will provide insights into the curatorial process, emphasizing the dialogue between concurrent programming and their role in bridging art, science, and technology from a pluriversal lens. Additionally, they will outline upcoming events, publications, and community workshops designed to deepen public engagement and foster a broader understanding of transdisciplinary themes. Rincón (Exhibition coordinator, Monuments) will share on the process of VR production pedagogical curriculum in development. This discussion will be a thought-provoking exploration of contemporary digital art practices, underscoring the importance of community, inclusivity, and diversity in the digital age. All activities are part of DAC Arts Community Engagement Programming led by Conlisk Gallegos and Rincón.","community, curator, digital",General Research,https://s2024.conference-program.org/presentation/?id=villip_124&sess=sess351
